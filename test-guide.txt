Based on the **assessment description you shared**, the tests you would write are mostly **unit and integration tests** for your React + TypeScript app. Since this is an **intermediate+ frontend test**, the focus is on **functional correctness, edge cases, and user interactions**, not just basic rendering.

Here’s a **structured breakdown** of what tests make sense:

---

## 1️⃣ **Login Page**

### Positive Scenarios

* User can input valid email/username and password
* Submit button is enabled when inputs are valid
* On successful login, user is redirected to the dashboard
* Local storage/session storage updates correctly on login (if applicable)

### Negative Scenarios

* Submitting empty fields shows validation errors
* Invalid email format shows error
* Incorrect password triggers an error message
* Submit button is disabled when inputs are invalid
* Form does not submit if there are validation errors

### Edge Cases

* Maximum input length handling
* XSS / special characters handling in inputs

---

## 2️⃣ **Dashboard Page**

### Positive Scenarios

* Mock API is fetched correctly and table/grid renders 500 user records
* Filtering by status, organization, or other fields updates the display correctly
* Sorting functionality (if present) works correctly
* Pagination or virtual scrolling works (if implemented)
* Responsive layout works on mobile, tablet, desktop

### Negative Scenarios

* API failure shows an error state
* Empty dataset shows “No records found”
* Filter inputs with invalid values do not break the table
* Table does not crash with missing data fields

---

## 3️⃣ **User Page / User Details Page**

### Positive Scenarios

* Clicking a user opens the user details page
* User details are correctly saved to **local storage or IndexedDB**
* User details page reads data from storage correctly
* Editing user details (if allowed) updates storage
* Back navigation returns to dashboard with filters preserved

### Negative Scenarios

* Attempting to open a user that doesn’t exist shows error / fallback
* Data corruption in local storage doesn’t crash the page
* Handling of missing or undefined fields

---

## 4️⃣ **Reusable Components / UI Elements**

### Positive Scenarios

* Select dropdowns show all options correctly
* Buttons respond to clicks
* Loading spinners show during API fetch
* Alerts / modals show and dismiss correctly

### Negative Scenarios

* Selecting invalid option does not break filter
* Clicking disabled buttons does nothing
* Modals close properly even when esc key is pressed

---

## 5️⃣ **Integration Tests**

* Login → Dashboard → User Details flow works end-to-end
* Filters + API + Table render together correctly
* Local storage persistence works across page reloads
* Mobile responsiveness preserves functionality (can test with `window.innerWidth` in Jest / React Testing Library)

---

## 6️⃣ **Unit Tests (Recommended for Intermediate+)**

* Components render correctly with given props
* Props validation (TypeScript + runtime where necessary)
* Utility functions (e.g., filtering, sorting, local storage helpers) produce correct results
* Edge cases for data formatting (dates, phone numbers, emails)

---

## 7️⃣ **Suggested Testing Tools**

* **React Testing Library** → for component rendering and interactions
* **Jest** → for unit and integration tests
* **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** → to mock API calls
* **Cypress / Playwright** → optional, for end-to-end flow testing (login → dashboard → user details)

---

## 8️⃣ **Example Test Scenarios in Code**

```ts
// Example: React Testing Library + Jest
test('login form shows validation errors', () => {
  render(<LoginPage />);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Login'));
  expect(screen.getByText('Email is required')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText('Password is required')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test('dashboard displays users after API fetch', async () => {
  render(<Dashboard />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getAllByRole('row')).toHaveLength(500));
});

test('filter by organization works', async () => {
  render(<Dashboard />);
  const select = screen.getByRole('combobox');
  fireEvent.change(select, { target: { value: 'Lendsqr' } });
  await waitFor(() =>
    expect(screen.getAllByText('Lendsqr').length).toBeGreaterThan(0)
  );
});

test('user details saved to local storage', async () => {
  render(<UserDetails userId="1" />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(localStorage.getItem('user-1')).not.toBeNull());
});
```

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways for the Assessment

1. **Positive & negative scenarios** are required
2. **Edge cases** matter (missing data, invalid inputs)
3. **Persistence & API** should be tested
4. **Responsive / visual fidelity** isn’t automated, but component structure should support it
5. **Code coverage is a bonus**, but correctness + maintainability is more important

If you want, I can create a **full test plan table** for **all 4 pages**, including:

* Test type (unit/integration)
* Scenario
* Expected outcome

This would give you a ready-to-implement testing checklist.

Do you want me to do that?
