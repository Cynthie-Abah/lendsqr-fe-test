LENDSQR FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT ASSESSMENT TEST  

This repository contains the completed assessment for the frontend engineering position at Lendsqr. The assessment involved building four pages using React with TypeScript and SCSS, based on a provided design. The assessment aimed to evaluate the candidate's skills in front-end development, code quality, and adherence to design specifications. 

  

 Pages Implemented 

  

The assessment required building the following pages: 

  

1. Login Page: Allows users to log in to the application. This login bar uses the following email and password to login; email: cynthie@gmail.com, password: wfubrfyub2343.  

2. Dashboard Page: Displays a dashboard with relevant information and data about the 500 records fetched from a mock API. 

3. User Page: Shows a list of users fetched from a mock API. I implemented the use of JSON generator to generate the 500 records used to test the web application and mocky.io for the API mocking as suggested in the test assessment instructions. 

4. User Details Page: Displays detailed information about a selected user and allows storing and retrieving user details using local storage. 

  

TECH STACK 

 The following technologies were used for this assessment: 

 React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

 TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enables enhanced code quality and development experience. 

SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that offers additional functionalities and organization to stylesheets.
